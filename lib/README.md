# ngx-build-plus-sistel

The real work is in https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus
This repo is a copy from manfredsteyer plus a fix (https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus/pull/28)

Extend the Angular CLI's default build behavior without ejecting:

- üì¶ Build a single bundle (e. g. for Angular Elements)
- üìÑ Extend the default behavior by providing a **partial** config that just contains your additional settings
- üìÑ Alternative: Extend the default behavior by providing a custom function
- ‚òëÔ∏è Inherits from the default builder, hence you have the same options
- üç∞ Simple to use
- ‚èèÔ∏è No eject needed

## Useful not only for Angular Elements

The original use case for this was to create a bundle for Angular Elements by extending the CLI's default builder. Besides this,``ngx-build-plus`` is also usable when you want to enhance other build setups with a partial webpack config.

It allows you to provide a single bundle that can be distributed easily.

Using an partial webpack config, you could e. g. define packages as externals. They can be loaded separately into the shell (hosting application). This allows several individually loaded Custom Elements sharing common packages like ``@angular/core`` etc.

## Tested with CLI 6.x and CLI 7.0.x

This package has been created and tested with Angular CLI 6.x. and CLI 7.0.x. If the CLI's underlying API changes in future, I'll provide an respective update for this version too until the CLI has build-in features for the covered use cases.

## Breaking Change in Version 7

- The switch ``single-bundle`` now defaults to false to align with the CLI's default behavior.

## Usage

The next steps guides you through getting started with ``ngx-build-plus`` by an example that uses Angular Elements. The result of this description can be found in the [repository's](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) ``sample`` directory.

1. Create a new Angular CLI based project and install ``@angular/elements`` as well as ``@webcomponents/custom-elements`` which provides needed polyfills:

    ```
    ng add @angular/elements
    npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements --save
    ```

2. Expose a component as an Custom Element:

    ```TypeScript
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { NgModule, Injector } from '@angular/core';
    import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';

    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            BrowserModule
        ],
        declarations: [
            AppComponent
        ],
        providers: [],
        bootstrap: [],
        entryComponents:[AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule {

        constructor(private injector: Injector) {
        }

        ngDoBootstrap() {
            const elm = createCustomElement(AppComponent, { injector: this.injector });
            customElements.define('custom-element', elm);
        }

    }
    ```
1. Install ``ngx-build-plus``:

    ```
    npm install ngx-build-plus --save-dev
    ```

3. Open your ``angular.json`` and tell the CLI to use ``ngx-build-plus`` instead of the default one:

    ```
      [...]
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "ngx-build-plus:build",
          [...]
        }
      }
      [...]
    ```

1. Create a file ``webpack.extra.js`` with a partial webpack config that tells webpack to exclude packages like ``@angular/core``:

    ```JavaScript
    module.exports = {
        "externals": {
            "rxjs": "rxjs",
            "@angular/core": "ng.core",
            "@angular/common": "ng.common",
            "@angular/platform-browser": "ng.platformBrowser",
            "@angular/elements": "ng.elements"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Build your application:

    ```
    ng build --prod --extraWebpackConfig webpack.extra.js --output-hashing none --single-bundle true
    ```

1. You will see that just one bundle (besides the ``script.js`` that could also be shared) is built. The size of the ``main.js`` tells you, that the mentioned packages have been excluded.

    ![Result](result.png)

2. Copy the bundle into a project that references the UMD versions of all external libraries and your ``main.ts``. You can find such a project with all the necessary script files in the ``deploy`` folder of the sample.

    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
        <!-- Polyfills for Browsers supporting
            Custom Elements. Needed b/c we downlevel
            to ES5. See: @webcomponents/custom-elements
        -->
        <script src="./native-shim.js"></script>

        <!-- Polyfills for Browsers not supporting
            Custom Elements. See: @webcomponents/custom-elements
        -->
        <script src="./custom-elements.min.js"></script>

        <!-- Zone.js -->
        <!--
        Consider excluding zone.js when creating
        Custom Elements by using the noop zone.
        -->
        <script src="./zone.js"></script>

        <!-- Rx -->
        <script src="./rxjs.umd.js"></script>

        <!-- Angular Packages -->
        <script src="./core.umd.js"></script>
        <script src="./common.umd.js"></script>
        <script src="./platform-browser.umd.js"></script>
        <script src="./elements.umd.js"></script>

        <!-- Custom Element -->
        <script src="./custom-element.bundle.js"></script>

        <!-- Calling Custom Element -->
        <custom-element></custom-element>

        <!--
        Here we could call additional custom elements
        reusing the loaded packages above.
        -->

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. Test your solution.

**Hint:** For production, consider using the minified versions of those bundles. They can be found in the ``node_modules`` folder after npm installing them.


## Builder for ng serve

This package provides also an builder that allows to specify an additional webpack configuration for ``ng serve``.

To use it, just register the ``ngx-build-plus:dev-server`` builder in your ``angular.json`` for the ``serve`` target:

```json
 "serve": {
          "builder": "ngx-build-plus:dev-server",
          [...]
 }
```

After that, you can call ``ng serve`` with an ``extraWebpackConfig`` switch:

```
ng serve --extraWebpackConfig webpack.serve.extra.js -o
```

To try this out, you can use the following webpack config as an example:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
            "VERSION": JSON.stringify("4711")
        })
    ]
}
```

This config defines a symbol ``VERSION`` with a value ``4711``. Hence, the following code should print out the version 4711.

```typescript
declare let VERSION: string;
console.debug('VERSION', VERSION);
```

## Using a custom function to modify the webpack config

For more advanced modifications you can provide a function that gets the webpack config passed and returns the modified one.

Follow the following steps to try it out:

1. Add a file with a config hook to your project (``hook/hook.ts``):

    ```typescript
    export default (cfg) => {
        console.debug('config', cfg);
        // mess around with wepback config here ...
        return cfg;
    }
    ```

2. Compile your solution using ``tsc``.

3. Use the ``configHook`` switch to point to the compiled version of your hook:

    ```
    ng build --configHook ~dist/out-tsc/hook/hook
    ```

The prefix ``~`` is replaced with your current directory. If you don't use it, it points to a installed ``node_module``.
